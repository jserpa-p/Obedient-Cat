# Obedient-Cat
First challenge of picoCTF

In this first challenge they ask you to find the pico flag.

"This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear")."

The file that you'll download is not a text file or any other look a like. But if you open it in your text editor you'll find the flag.
